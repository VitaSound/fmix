FMix is a build tool that provides tasks for creating, and testing Forth packages, managing its dependencies, and more.

Format of package description, as example:

`package.4th`

```
forth-package
    key-value name fmix
    key-value version 0.1.0
    key-value license COPL
    key-value description Forth build tool
    key-value main fmix.4th
    / key-value dependencies_path_fmix
    / packages from git
    / key-list dependencies <package_name> git <http-url> [branch|tag] <name>
    key-list dependencies ftest git https://github.com/UA3MQJ/ftest.git branch main
    key-list dependencies ftest git https://github.com/UA3MQJ/ftest.git branch special_branch
    key-list dependencies ftest git https://github.com/UA3MQJ/ftest.git tag 0.1.0
    / packages from theforth.net
    / key-list dependencies <package_name> <version>
    key-list dependencies f 0.2.4
end-forth-package
```

By default, packages stored to `./forth-packages`

```
include ./forth-packages/ftest/main/ftest.4th
```


IF exist key `key-value dependencies_path_fmix` then dependencies of all packages stored to ~/fmix/forth-packages/<dep_name>/<branch|tag>


This structure allows:

* to store all dependencies in one place
* to have the ability to work with different versions of one dependency.

Using dependencies in our packages

```
include ~/fmix/forth-packages/ftest/main/ftest.4th
```
